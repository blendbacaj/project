    <h3>History of Club</h3>

  <p>
	<strong>AC Milan</strong> was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriate <strong>Herbert Kilpin</strong>. The club claims <i>16 December</i> of that year as their foundation date,
	 but historical evidence seems to suggest that the club was actually founded a few days earlier, most likely on <em>13 December</em>
	However, with the club's charter being lost, the exact date remains open to debate.<br>
	<br>
	


	 <b>Milan's</b> 18 FIFA and UEFA trophies is the fourth highest out of any club (joint with Boca Juniors), and the most out of any Italian club.
	 Milan has won a joint record three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup, seven <abbrs title="Champions Leauge">CL</abbrs> titles (Italian record), the UEFA Super Cup a joint record five times and the Cup Winners' Cup twice.
	 With  <del>18 league titles</del> <ins>19 league titles</ins>,<strong>Milan </strong> is tied as the second most successful club in Serie A with local rivals Inter Milan (also with 19 league titles), behind Juventus (36 league titles). 
	 have also won the <em> Coppa Italia </em> five times, and the <em>Supercoppa Italiana</em> seven.
